DR PEPPERDr Pepper is the number 3 soft drink in the United States after Coca-Cola  and   Pepsi  Cola.     It   was   created   by  a   pharmacist   (or “chemist” if you want to speak like a Brit) in 1885 in Waco, Texas. This   was   one   year   before   Coca-Cola   was   released,   making   Dr Pepper the oldest soft drink on the market in the United States.  By the way,  “soft drink” is a synonym  for “soda” or “pop” (a little old fashioned)......and many people   in  the US often refer to  soda   as simply “Coke”, even when referring to non-Coca-Cola products!In addition to being the oldest, Dr Pepper is also perhaps the most unique soda.   It contains 23 flavors, but the exact recipe is proprietary  information.   Many people try to speculate about what exactly Dr Pepper is made of.   One theory was that Dr Pepper is largely prune juice mixed with other flavors.   However, the official web site of Dr Pepper added a response to this rumor in their “FAQ” section, insisting that prune juice was not even one of the 23 flavors which make up Dr Pepper.  Have you tried Dr Pepper?  What do you think it tastes like?Do you think that there is a connection between the Beatles and Dr Pepper?   Well, there is!   Have you  heard of the Beatles' album “Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club”?   Well, the original title was   supposed   to   be  “Dr.   Pepper's   Lonely   Hearts  Club”,   but   just before release, the Beatles found out that  an American soft drink company already owned the rights to that name, so they changed the “Dr.” to “Sgt.”.   The Beatles, particularly John Lennon, liked Dr Pepper, though.   Lennon even had cases of it shipped to England while they were working on the “Imagine” album!  Fans of Dr Pepper are called “Peppers”, so it turns out that John Lennon was a true Pepper!Hilary Clinton is also a Pepper.  During one of her first trips as First Lady, a flight attendant on Air Force One asked her what she would like to drink.   She  replied, “You know, I really feel like a Diet Dr Pepper.”   From that point forward, the Clinton  administration's aides and assistants knew to keep plenty of Dr Pepper (the diet version!) in Mrs. Clinton's refrigerator.What about Sarah Palin and Dr Pepper?  Is there a connection?  Yes, there is!  Sarah Palin, you might recall, was the 11th Governor of Alaska, and was also John McCain's choice to be   the   Vice   Presidential   nominee   on   the   Republican   Presidential   ticket   for   2008.    After Democratic   Senator   Barack   Obama   won   a   decisive   victory   over   McCain   in   the   2008 Presidential election, Republicans at all levels blamed many different people for their loss - including each other.  In particular, members of McCain's campaign placed a great deal of the blame on the scandal associated with a "shopping spree" of Sarah Palin's that totaled in excess of $150,000  for clothes  and  accessories which  were ultimately  paid  for by  the Republican National Committee.
